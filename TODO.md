- document check-deps.sh in README
- document keeping sources up to date and benefit of monorepo in accomplishing this

- run another service that is not node. maybe .net core and/or scala.
- make the README more complete
- cross platform support so everyone can run it (tested on osx, ubuntu and alpine. windows pending.)
