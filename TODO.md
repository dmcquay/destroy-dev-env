- run another service that is not node. maybe .net core and/or scala.
- make the README more complete
- add a file or section to README that explains all the elements on display in this project

- make the app more relevant. place to submit comments/questions?
- make UI look nicer just for fun
- cross platform support so everyone can run it (tested on osx, ubuntu and alpine. windows pending.)

- rabbit + listeners? maybe not necessary. not categorically new.
